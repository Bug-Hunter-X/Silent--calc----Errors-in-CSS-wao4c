The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there is a syntax error within the `calc()` expression, it may not be immediately obvious in the browser's developer tools.  For example, using an incorrect operator or missing operands can lead to unexpected results or no visual change at all.  The error might not be explicitly reported as a CSS error, making debugging challenging.
